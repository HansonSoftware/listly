# Listly

Manage your daily tasks right in the terminal.

This TUI allows you to efficiently organize your TODO list with vim-like keybinds.

## TODO:

- [x] Come up with short but awesome name
- [x] Create repo and go.mod
- [x] Model datatypes
- [x] Display TUI
- [x] Make TUI appealing to look at (thanks charm cli)
- [ ] Welcome page / session organizer
- Example: I can have a long list of TODO items in a list called 2025, and I can choose to open that session, or I can just start a new session with todays date
- [ ] Load new session by default with current date as name
- [x] Create columns (TODO / In Progress / Done)
- [x] Create form (for todos)
- [x] Move todos to other columns (when complete or in progress)
- [x] Delete todos
- [ ] Undo list (with U keybind and a stack)
- [ ] Save lists / session with keybind Ctrl-S
- [ ] Saving popup
- [ ] Choose and connect to a local DB
- [ ] Store sessions in DB
- [x] Allow tab & shift-tab movement between cols
- [ ] Implement intuitive keybinds
- [x] Fix bug where keybinds are registered in filter or new task
